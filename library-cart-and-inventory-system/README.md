  - *(Planned)* Manual camera selection through dropdown menu

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Complete database of library books
  - Real-time inventory tracking
  - Book information display in a viewable format
  - Automatic book cover retrieval and updates
  - *(Planned)* Direct editing of book quantities and details
  - *(Planned)* Bulk book registration capabilities

- **Transaction System**:
  - *(Planned)* Shopping cart functionality for book checkouts
  - *(Planned)* Transaction history tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash

ng serve
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:4200

### Mobile Testing

To test the application (including barcode scanning) on a mobile device:

1. Start the server with host configuration:
```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

2. Find your computer's IP address:
- Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
- Look for IPv4 Address (usually starts with 192.168. or 10.0.)

3. On your mobile device:
- Connect to the same WiFi network as your computer
- Open browser and navigate to `http://<your-computer-ip>:4200`
- Allow camera permissions when prompted
- The app will automatically select the back camera for scanning

## Development Status
The application is currently in active development with the following status:

- âœ… Basic component structure established
- âœ… Barcode scanning functionality implemented
- âœ… Initial inventory display component created
- âœ… Automatic book cover retrieval system
- ðŸš§ Smart camera device selection (In Progress)
- ðŸš§ Manual camera selection UI (Planned)
- ðŸš§ Database integration (In Progress)
- ðŸš§ Shopping cart functionality (Planned)
- ðŸš§ Transaction system (Planned)

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Angular 19.2.0
- Barcode Scanning: @zxing/browser
- Book Cover API: [Your chosen API]
- Styling: CSS with responsive design
- *(Planned)* Backend & Database: TBD

## Component Details

### Book Cover Update Function
The automatic book cover update system works as follows:
1. Monitors the inventory database for books without cover images
2. Uses book metadata (title and author) to search for cover images
3. Automatically updates the database with found cover images
4. Handles cases where covers aren't found with placeholder images
5. Implements rate limiting and caching for API efficiency

### Camera Device Selection
The camera handling system includes:
1. **Automatic Detection**:
   - Scans available video input devices
   - Identifies device type (mobile/desktop)
   - Categorizes cameras (front/back/external)

2. **Smart Selection Logic**:
   - Mobile: Prioritizes back camera for better barcode scanning
   - Desktop: Uses primary webcam
   - Handles permission requests automatically

3. *(Planned)* **Manual Selection UI**:
   - Dropdown menu listing all available cameras
   - Clear device labels for easy identification
   - Persistent selection storage
   - Real-time camera switching

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Book categorization system
- Member management system
- Checkout history tracking
- Statistical reports and analytics
- Email notifications for due dates
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Multiple camera support improvements
- Enhanced book cover management system
